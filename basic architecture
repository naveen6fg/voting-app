Voting System Architecture and Design

1. Architecture:
   The application follows a layered architecture with the following components:
   - Controller (VotingController): Handles HTTP requests and responses
   - Service (VotingService): Contains business logic and manages data
   - Model (Candidate): Represents the data structure

2. Design Patterns:
   - Singleton: Spring's dependency injection ensures a single instance of VotingService
   - MVC: Separation of concerns between Controller, Service, and Model

3. Data Storage:
   - In-memory storage using ConcurrentHashMap for thread-safe operations

4. Concurrency:
   - ConcurrentHashMap for thread-safe access to candidate data
   - Synchronized blocks for atomic operations on individual candidates

5. API Design:
   - RESTful API design with appropriate HTTP methods and status codes
   - Query parameters for input data

6. Testing:
   - Unit tests for VotingService to ensure correct functionality

7. Scalability:
   - The current design can handle multiple users simultaneously
   - For higher scalability, consider distributed caching or a database backend

8. Security:
   - Input validation to prevent malicious inputs
   - Consider adding authentication and authorization for production use
